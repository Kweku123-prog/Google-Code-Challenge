# Google-Code-Challenge
In this Project  I am are going to implement various components of a command-line application
simulating YouTube. The result of my code will be a fully working command-line application,
simulating how a user would interact with YouTube in real life but without any of the web
elements. This is a big part of what a software engineer would be doing at Google, just on a
much greater scale
